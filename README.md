# ToDoList-Go

**ToDoList-Go** is a robust and scalable to-do list application built with a microservice architecture. It allows users to create, track, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project demonstrates key concepts of microservices, event-driven architecture, and efficient task management. 🚀

## Features

- **API Service**: Handles HTTP requests for task operations (create, retrieve, delete, update).
- **Database Service**: Manages interactions with a PostgreSQL database, storing task data and managing task statuses. 🗄️
- **Optional Kafka Service**: Logs events and task actions for improved observability and tracking.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the microservices, making it easy to deploy and scale the application.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs incoming requests, outgoing responses, and errors for troubleshooting.
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Ensures the reliability and correctness of the system. ✔️

## Architecture

The application is built using the following microservices:

- **API Service**: Responsible for accepting HTTP requests from the user and interacting with the database service.
- **Database Service**: Connects to PostgreSQL and handles CRUD operations for tasks.
- **Kafka Service** (optional): Listens for events from the API service and logs actions in Kafka for event tracking.
